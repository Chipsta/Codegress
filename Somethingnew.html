<p> If I wanted your help, I would have asked you, but you think it's your job to teach me your fucked up way of depositing!!?!?!? </p>
<p>You piss me off, my god I don't want to even be doing this right now. Sure, a helpful overview would be fine, and an offer to support me if I get stuck, but your way of showing me was WAY too much information, and the longest way to doing something. </p>
